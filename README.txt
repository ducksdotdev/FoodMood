# FoodMood
FoodMood application for IST 412 (Haynes)



Dylan Straffon:

Design Pattern: The design pattern I selected earlier (search filters) is not
relevant to the use cases that we have implemented so far. In place of search
filters I have implemented confirmation messages within the FoodList and
MoodList to ensure users know when they have successfully added a food or mood
to the application. These help users get a better understanding of how well the
application is working.

Object Oriented Pattern: My object oriented pattern of a singleton class is 
implemented within the userList of the application. This is done to prevent
multiple different users from creating accounts with the same username, 
preventing login and storage issues.
