# FoodMood
FoodMood application for IST 412 (Haynes)



Dylan Straffon:

Design Pattern: The design pattern I selected earlier (search filters) is not
relevant to the use cases that we have implemented so far. In place of search
filters I have implemented confirmation messages within the FoodList and
MoodList to ensure users know when they have successfully added a food or mood
to the application. These help users get a better understanding of how well the
application is working.

Object Oriented Pattern: My object oriented pattern of a singleton class is 
implemented within the userList of the application. This is done to prevent
multiple different users from creating accounts with the same username, 
preventing login and storage issues.

Design Pattern: I selected Fill in the blanks for my design pattern. Fill in the
blanks plays a huge role in how our app functions for users to input information.
What I worked on for this sprint was the login UI and the food UI. both involve 
the user entering information in the app to process like user's login and new foods
consummed. The app will be able to process that information and make it usable for
the user.

Object Oriented Pattern: The object oriented design pattern I selected was factories.
I implemented factories for food creation. The app has a class within food that pulls
information from the food ui to create new foods. THe new object can be viewed, edited,
deleted, etc.
